This is my solution to the iExpense project (project 7) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by
Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). Updated to include an edit button on the navigation bar to enable / disable delete mode and some styling on the type and amount fields of an expense item.
